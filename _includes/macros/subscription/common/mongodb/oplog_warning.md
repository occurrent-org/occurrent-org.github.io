<div class="comment">It's important to recognize that MongoDB subscriptions are using the <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-oplog/">oplog</a> so you need to make sure that 
you have enough oplog capacity to support your use case. You can also read more about this <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/#startafter-for-change-streams">here</a>.
Typically this shouldn't be a problem, but if you have subscribers that risk falling behind, you may consider piping the events to e.g. Kafka and leverage it for these types of subscriptions.
Note that you can always use a <a href="#catch-up-subscription-blocking">catch-up subscription</a> to recover if this happens.</div>
