Occurrent 0.16.4 is released with the following changes:

* Added a kotlin extension function that makes it easier to execute a `RetryStrategy` with a "Supplier".
    
    The reasons for this is that when just doing this from kotlin:
    
    ```
    val string = retryStrategy.execute { "hello" }
    ```
    
    This will return `Unit` and not the "hello" string that you would expect.
    This is because execute in the example above delegates to org.occurrent.retry.RetryStrategy.execute(java.lang.Runnable)
    and not org.occurrent.retry.RetryStrategy.execute(java.util.function.Supplier<T>) which one would expect.
    Thus, you can use this function instead to avoid specifying the `Supplier` SAM explicitly.
    
    I.e. instead of doing:
    
    ```kotlin
      val string : String = retryStrategy.execute(Supplier { "hello" })
    ```
    
    you can do:
    
    ```kotlin
      val string : String = retryStrategy.exec { "hello" }
    ```
    
    after having imported `org.occurrent.retry.exec`.
* Kotlin jvm target is set to 17
* Added ability to map errors with `RetryStrategy`, either by doing:

  ```
  retryStrategy
              .mapError(IllegalArgumentException.class, IllegalStateException::new)
              .maxAttempts(2)
              .execute(() -> {
                  throw new IllegalArgumentException("expected");
              }));
  ```
  
  In the end, an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown. You can also do like this:

  ```
  retryStrategy
              .mapError(t -> {
                  if (t instanceof IllegalArgumentException iae) {
                      return new IllegalStateException(iae.getMessage());
                  } else {
                      return t;
                  }
              })
              .maxAttempts(2)
              .execute(() -> {
                  throw new IllegalArgumentException("expected");
              }));
  ```
* Added a new `execute` Kotlin extension function to the `ApplicationService` that allows one to use a `java.util.UUID` as a streamId when working with lists of events (as opposed to `Sequence`).
* Upgraded xstream from 1.4.19 to 1.4.20
* Added better logging to `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.spring.blocking.SpringMongoSubscriptionModel`, including some debug logs that can be used for detailed information about what's going on. 
* Upgraded Kotlin from 1.8.21 to 1.9.0
* Upgraded Spring Boot from 3.0.6 to 3.0.7
* Upgraded Spring Aspects from 6.0.9 to 6.0.10
