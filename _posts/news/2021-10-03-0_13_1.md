Occurrent 0.13.0 and 0.13.1 is now available. The main, major update, is that reading event streams from MongoDB event stores are both faster and more reliable since they no longer need transactions.  

Changelog 0.13.1:

* No longer using transactional reads in `ReactorMongoEventStore`, this also means that the `transactionalReads` configuration setting is removed since it's no longer used.

Changelog 0.13.0:

* Reading event streams from `MongoEventStore` and `SpringMongoEventStore` are now much faster and more reliable. Before there was a bug in both implementation in which
  the stream could be abruptly closed when reading a large number of events. This has now been fixed, and as a consequence, Occurrent doesn't need to start a MongoDB transaction
  when reading an event stream, which improves performance.
* Removed the `transactionalReads` configuration setting (introduced in previous release) from `EventStoreConfig` for both `MongoEventStore` and `SpringMongoEventStore` since it's no longer needed.
* Upgraded jackson from version 2.11.1 to 2.12.5
