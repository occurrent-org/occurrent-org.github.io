title: Custom jetty handlers
summary: Allows you to configure the embedded jetty server with custom handlers

## Custom jetty handlers
Occurrent 1.2.0 introduces the possibility of adding custom jetty handlers, such as `StatisticsHandler` and `RequestLogHandler`.\\
You can configure your embedded jetty-server with a handler-chain
([example](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/blob/master/src/test/java/io/occurrent/TestCustomJetty.java#L66-L82)),
and Occurrent will attach it's own handlers to the end of this chain.

{% capture java %}
StatisticsHandler statisticsHandler = new StatisticsHandler();

Occurrent.create()
    .embeddedServer(new EmbeddedJettyFactory(() -> {
        Server server = new Server();
        server.setHandler(statisticsHandler);
        return server;
    }))
    .start();
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
val statisticsHandler = StatisticsHandler()

Occurrent.create().apply {
    embeddedServer(EmbeddedJettyFactory({
        Server(queuedThreadPool).apply {
            handler = statisticsHandler
        }
    }))
}.start();
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippetKotlinFirst.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}

Doing this will allow you to integrate Occurrent with for example prometheus easily,
by exposing statistics collected by the `StatisticsHandler`.\\
There's even a tutorial to show you how that's done: [/tutorials/prometheus-example](/tutorials/prometheus-example)

## EventManager cleanup
There was a bug in the `Event` data class, where properties were declared as `var` instead of `val`.
The `Occurrent` val was nullable for no apparent reason, so that's been fixed too.

## Kotlin 1.2.0
Kotlin has been bumped to 1.2.0
