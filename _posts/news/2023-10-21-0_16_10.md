Occurrent 0.16.10 is released with the following changes:

* Several changes to `RetryStrategy` again:
  1. `onError` is will be called for each throwable again. The new `ErrorInfo` instance, that is supplied to the error listener, can be used to determine whether the error is "final" or if it's retryable.
  2. In the previous version, `onBeforeRetry` and `onAfterRetry`, accepted a `BiConsumer<RetryInfo, Throwable>`. The arguments have now been reversed, so the types of the BiConsumer is now `BiConsumer<Throwable, RetryInfo>`.
