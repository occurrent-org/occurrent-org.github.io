Occurrent 0.16.2 is released with the following changes:

* Upgraded Kotlin from 1.7.20 to 1.8.0
* Upgraded cloudevents to 2.4.1
* Improvements to `SpringMongoSubscriptionModel` in which it'll restart the subscription from the default subscription position instead of now on unknown or query-related MongoDB errors. This eliminates the risk of loosing messages if using a durable subscription model.
* Fixed a subtle bug in `SpringMongoLeaseCompetingConsumerStrategy` in which it _could_ crash in some cases where MongoDB was down for more than 30 seconds.
* Upgraded to Spring Boot 3.0.3
* Upgraded spring-aspects from 6.0.2 to 6.0.6
