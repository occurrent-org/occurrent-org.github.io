Occurrent 0.16.3 is released with the following changes:

* Added support to the retry module to execute retries with a function that takes an instance of `org.occurrent.retry.RetryInfo`. This is useful if you need to know the current state of your of the retry while retrying. For example:
  ```java  
  RetryStrategy retryStrategy = RetryStrategy
                                  .exponentialBackoff(initialDelay, maxDelay, 2.0)
                                  .maxAttempts(10)
  retryStrategy.execute(info -> {
        if (info.getNumberOfAttempts() > 2 &&  info.getNumberOfAttempts() < 6) {
            System.out.println("Number of attempts is between 3 and 5");
        }
        ...     
  });
  ```
