Occurrent 0.6.0 is now available. It mainly focuses on reliability improvements to several components to prepare them for production use.
Specifically, all blocking subscriptions and subscription position storage modules, now have defaults to retrying failed operations to the datastore and your event handling methods. 
Retries can be controlled, and disabled, when creating the component (by passing `RetryStrategy.none()` to the constructor). It's fine to disable the default retry strategy
for a subscription model and handle it in the `action` (event callback) instead if you 
want to make it explicit.

Changes are:

* Renamed method `shutdownSubscribers` in `DurableSubscriptonModel` to `shutdown`.
* Added default subscription name to subscription DSL. You can now do:

    ```kotlin
    subscriptions(subscriptionModel) {
        subscribe<NameDefined> { e ->
            log.info("Hello ${e.name}")
        }
    }
    ```
    
    The id of the subscription will be "NameDefine" (the unqualified name of the `NameDefined` class).
* Added `exists` method to `EventStoreQueries` API (both blocking and reactive). This means that you can easily check if events exists, for example:

    ```kotlin
    val doesSomeTypeExists = eventStoreQueries.exists(type("sometype"))
    ```
* Added retry strategy support to SpringMongoSubscriptionPositionStorage. You can define your own by passing an instance of `RetryStrategy` to the constructor. By default
  it'll add a retry strategy with exponential backoff starting with 100 ms and progressively go up to max 2 seconds wait time between 
  each retry when reading/saving/deleting the subscription position.
* Added retry strategy support to NativeMongoSubscriptionPositionStorage. You can define your own by passing an instance of `RetryStrategy` to the constructor. By default
  it'll add a retry strategy with exponential backoff starting with 100 ms and progressively go up to max 2 seconds wait time between 
  each retry when reading/saving/deleting the subscription position.
* Added retry strategy support to SpringRedisSubscriptionPositionStorage. You can define your own by passing an instance of `RetryStrategy` to the constructor. By default
  it'll add a retry strategy with exponential backoff starting with 100 ms and progressively go up to max 2 seconds wait time between 
  each retry when reading/saving/deleting the subscription position.
* Added retry strategy support to SpringMongoSubscriptionModel. You can define your own by passing an instance of `RetryStrategy` to the constructor. By default
  it'll add a retry strategy with exponential backoff starting with 100 ms and progressively go up to max 2 seconds wait time between 
  each retry when exceptions are thrown from the `action` callback (the callback that you implement to handle a `CloudEvent` instance from a subscription).
* All blocking subscription models will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if a subscription is registered more than once.
