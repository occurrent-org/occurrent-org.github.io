Occurrent 0.1.1 is now available. It includes the following changes:

* Support for [catch-up subscriptions](https://occurrent.org/documentation#catch-up-subscription-blocking) (i.e. start a subscription at a historic position and not just "now").
* You can now supply a predicate to the [automatic position persistence](https://occurrent.org/documentation#automatic-subscription-position-persistence-blocking) that controls when an subscription position should be persisted. There's built in support to persist every n event as opposed to just _every_ event (which was the case in version 0.1.0). This has been implemented for both the blocking and reactive implementation.
* Added ability to "count" events (also using filters) to [EventStoreQueries](https://occurrent.org/documentation#eventstore-queries) (both blocking and reactive).
* Added ability to query for "data" attribute in [EventStoreQueries](https://occurrent.org/documentation#eventstore-queries) and [subscriptions](https://occurrent.org/documentation#subscriptions). This has been implemented for both the blocking and reactive implementations.

This release should not include any backward incompatible changes.
