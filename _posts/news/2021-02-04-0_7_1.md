Occurrent 0.7.1 is now available. It's a small release with a few dependency upgrades and bug fixes. Most notably is a fix that allows deploying Occurrent subscriptions to [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) free tier.

Changelog:

* Removed `org.occurrent:eventstore-inmemory` as dependency to `org.occurrent:application-service-blocking` (it should have been a test dependency) 
* Including a "details" message in `DuplicateCloudEventException` that adds more details on why this happens (which index etc). This is especially useful
  if you're creating custom, unique, indexes over the events and a write fail due to a duplicate cloud event.
* Upgraded to Kotlin 1.3.40
* Upgraded project-reactor to 3.4.2 (previously 3.4.0 was used)
* When running MongoDB subscriptions on services like Atlas, it's not possible to get the current time (global subscription position) when starting a new subscription since access is denied. 
  If this happens then the local time of the client is used instead.
