### Decider Support

Occurrent now has basic, somewhat experimental, support for [Deciders](https://thinkbeforecoding.com/post/2021/12/17/functional-event-sourcing-decider) (expect more functionality in the future). A decider is a model that can be implemented to get a structured way to implement decision logic for a business entity (typically aggregate) or use case.

To use a decider, you need to model your commands as explicit data structures (i.e. don't use higher-order function). 
To create a decider, first depend on `org.occurrent:decider:0.17.0`, then you can either implement the `org.occurrent.dsl.decider.Decider` interface or use the default implementation. The interface is defined like this:

```java
public interface Decider<C, S, E> {
    S initialState();

    @NotNull
    List<E> decide(@NotNull C command, S state);

    S evolve(S state, @NotNull E event);

    default boolean isTerminal(S state) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

where:

| Parameter Type | Description                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| C              | The type of the commands that the decider can handle |
| S              | The state that the decider works with                |
| E              | The type of events that the decider returns          |


The interface contains four methods:

| Method name  | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| initialState | Returns the initial state of the decider, for example `null` or something like "`NotStarted`" (a domain specific state implemented by you), depending on your domain |
| decide       | A function that takes a command and the current state and returns a list of new events that represents the changes the occurred after the commands was handled       |
| evolve       | A method that takes the current state and an event, and return an update state after applying this event                                                             |
| isTerminal   | An optional method that can be implemented/overridden to tell the Decider to stop evolving the state if the Decider has reached a specific state                     |

It's highly recommended to read [this](https://thinkbeforecoding.com/post/2021/12/17/functional-event-sourcing-decider) blog post to get a better understanding of the rationale behind Deciders. 

But you don't actually need to implement this interface yourself, instead you can create a default implementation by passing in functions to `Decider.create(..)`.

#### Java

Imagine that you have commands, events and state defined like this:

```java
sealed interface Command {
    record Command1(String something, String message) implements Command {
    }
    
    record Command2(String message) implements Command {
    }
}

sealed interface Event {
   record Event1(String something) implements Command {
   }
   
   record Event2(String somethingElse) implements Command {
   }
   
   record Event3(String message) implements Command {
   }
}

record State(String something, String somethingElse, String message) {
    // Other constructors excluded for brevity   
}
```

Then you can create a decider like this in Java (21+): 
             
```java
var decider = Decider.<Command, State, Event>create(
        null,
        (command, state) -> switch (command) {
            case Command1 c1 -> {
                if (s == null) {
                    yield List.of(new Event1(c1.something()));
                } else {
                    yield List.of(new Event3(c1.message()));
                }
            }
           case Command2 c2 -> List.of(new MyEvent2(c2.somethingElse()));
        },
        (state, event) -> switch (event) {
            case Event1 e1 -> new State(e1.something());    
            case Event2 e2 -> new State(s.something(), e2.message());    
            case Event3 e3 -> new State(s.something(), e3.somethingElse(), s.message());    
        }
);
```
<div class="comment">
You can pass an optional <code>Predicate</code> as a fourth argument to <code>Decider.create(..)</code> if you like to specify the <code>isTerminal</code> condition, otherwise it always returns <code>false</code> by default.
</div>

Now that you have an instance of `Decider`, you can then call any of the many default methods to return either the name state, the new events, or both. For example:

```java
List<Event> currentEvents = ...
Command command = ..

List<Event> newEvents = decider.decideOnEventsAndReturnEvents(currentEvents, command);
State newState = decider.decideOnEventsAndReturnState(currentEvents, command);
// Return both the state and the new events
Decision<State, List<Event>> decision = decider.decideOnEvents(currentEvents, command);
```

Or if you store state instead of events:

```java
State currentState = ...
Command command = ..

List<Event> newEvents = decider.decideOnStateAndReturnEvents(currentState, command);
State newState = decider.decideOnStateAndReturnState(currentState, command);
// Return both the state and the new events
Decision<State, List<Event>> decision = decider.decideOnState(currentState, command);
```

You can even apply multiple commands at the same time:

```java
List<Event> currentEvents = ...
Command command1 = ..
Command command2 = ..

List<Event> newEvents = decider.decideOnEventsAndReturnEvents(currentEvents, command1, command2);
```

Then both commands will be applied atomically.

#### Application Service from Java

To use the existing [ApplicationService](https://occurrent.org/documentation#application-service) infrastructure with Deciders, you can do like this:


```java
ApplicationService<Event> applicationService = ...
Command command = ...

// Because the decider expects a List<Event>, and not Stream<Event> as expected by the ApplicationService,
// we first convert the Stream to a List using the "toStreamCommand" function provided by Occurrent.
var writeResult = applicationService.execute("streamId", toStreamCommand(events -> decider.decideOnEventsAndReturnEvents(events, defineName)));
```
<div class="comment">
<code>toStreamCommand</code> can be statically imported from <code>org.occurrent.application.composition.command.toStreamCommand</code>.
</div>


#### Kotlin

The `org.occurrent:decider:0.17.0` module contains Kotlin extension functions, located in the `org.occurrent.dsl.decider.DeciderExtensions.kt` file, that makes deciders more idiomatic to work with from Kotlin.

Imagine that you have commands, events and state defined like this:

```kotlin
sealed interface Command {
    data class Command1(val something : String, val message : String) : Command
    data class Command2(val message : String) : Command
}

sealed interface Event {
   data class Event1(val something : String)
   data class Event2(val somethingElse : String)
   data class Event3(val message : String)
}

data class State(val something : String, val somethingElse : String, val message : String) {
    // Other constructors excluded for brevity   
}
```

Then you can create a decider like this in Kotlin: 
             
```kotlin
import org.occurrent.dsl.decider.decider

val decider = decider<Command, State?, Event>(
        initialState  = null,
        decide = { cmd, state -> 
            when (cmd) {
              is Command1 -> listOf(if (cmd == null) Event1(c1.something()) else Event3(c1.message()))
              is Command2 -> listOf(MyEvent2(c2.somethingElse()))
           }
        },
        evolve = { _, e ->
            when (e) {
                is Event1 -> State(e1.something())
                is Event2 -> State(s.something(), e2.message())
                is Event3 -> State(s.something(), e3.somethingElse(), s.message())
            }
        }
)
```
<div class="comment">
You can also, optionally, define a <code>isTerminal</code> predicate as a fourth argument to the <code>decider(..)</code> function if you need to specify this condition, otherwise it always returns <code>false</code> by default.
</div>

Now that you have an instance of `Decider`, you can then call any of the many default methods to return either the name state, the new events, or both. For example:

```kotlin
import org.occurrent.dsl.decider.decide
import org.occurrent.dsl.decider.component1
import org.occurrent.dsl.decider.component2

val currentEvents : List<Event> = ...
val currentState : State? = ...
val command : Command = ...

// We use destructuring here to get the "newState" and "newEvents" from the Decision instance returned by decide
// This is the reason for importing the "component1" and "component2" extension functions above 
val (newState, newEvents) = decider.decide(events = currentEvents, command = command)

// You can also start the computation based on the current state
val (newState, newEvents) = decider.decide(state = currentState, command = command)

// And you could of course also just use the actual "Decision" if you like
val decision : Decision<State, List<Event>> = decider.decide(events = currentEvents, command = command)

// You can also supply multiple commands at the same time, then all of them will succeed or fail atomically
val (newState, newEvents) = decider.decide(currentState, command1, command2)
```
<div class="comment">
You can also use the Java <code>decide</code> methods, such as <code>decideOnStateAndReturnEvent</code>, from Kotlin, but usually it's enough to just use the <code>org.occurrent.dsl.decider.decide</code> extension function.
</div>
 

#### Application Service from Kotlin

The `org.occurrent:decider:0.17.0` module contains Kotlin extension functions, located in the `org.occurrent.dsl.decider.ApplicationServiceDeciderExtensions.kt` file, that allows you to easily integrate deciders
with existing [ApplicationService](https://occurrent.org/documentation#application-service) infrastructure. Here's an example:

```kotlin
import org.occurrent.dsl.decider.execute

// Create the decider

val applicationService = ...
val decider = ... 
        

// Then you can pass the decider and command to the application service instance 
val writeResult = applicationService.execute(streamId, command, decider)
```

It's also possible to return the decision, state or new events when calling execute:

```kotlin
import org.occurrent.dsl.decider.executeAndReturnDecision
import org.occurrent.dsl.decider.executeAndReturnState
import org.occurrent.dsl.decider.executeAndReturnEvents

// Invoke the decider with the command and return both state and new events (decision) 
val decision = applicationService.executeAndReturnDecision(streamId, command, decider)
// Invoke the decider with the command and return the new state
val state = applicationService.executeAndReturnState(streamId, command, decider)
// Invoke the decider with the command and return the new events
val newEvents = applicationService.executeAndReturnEvents(streamId, command, decider)
```
    
### Changes
* `spring-boot-starter-mongodb` no longer autoconfigures itself by just importing the library in the classpath, instead you need to bootstrap by annotating your Spring Boot class with `@EnableOccurrent`. **Warning** This is a non-backward compatible change!    
* [Subscriptions DSL](https://occurrent.org/documentation#subscription-dsl) now accepts metadata as the first parameter when calling `subscribe` to create a new subscription, besides just the event. The metadata currently contains the stream version and stream id, which can be useful when building projections. For example:
  
  ```kotlin
  subscriptions(subscriptionModel, cloudEventConverter) {
      subscribe<GameStarted>("id1") { metadata, gameStarted ->
          log.info("Game was started $gameStarted, event version was ${metadata.streamVersion}")
      }
   } 
  ``` 
  `metadata` is an instance of `org.occurrent.dsl.subscription.blocking.EventMetadata`, and besides `streamVersion`, it also includes `streamId`, and all other cloud event extensions properties you've added when serializing the `CloudEvent`.
  All these properties are available in the `data` property.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed bug in spring-boot-starter-mongodb module in which it didn't automatically configure MongoDB.
* Fixed a bug in SpringMongoSubscriptionModel in which it didn't restart correctly on non DataAccessException's 
* Fixed a rare ConcurrentModificationException issue in SpringMongoSubscriptionModel if the subscription model is shutdown while it's restarting
