Occurrent 0.19.8 is released:

* Converted `org.occurrent.subscription.OccurrentSubscriptionFilter` from a Java class to a record. This means that the `public final` filter instance field is now a record property. So if you ever used `occurrentSubscriptionFilter.filter` to access the underlying filter, you now need to do `occurrentSubscriptionFilter.filter()` instead.
* Fixed a bug in MongoLeaseCompetingConsumerStrategySupport in which it was not marked a running on start. This could affect retries of certain competing consumer errors.
* Adding equals/hashcode and toString to SpringMongoSubscriptionModel, this is useful in certain debug logging scenarios
* Upgraded spring-boot from 3.3.5 to 3.4.1
* Upgraded spring-data-mongodb from 4.3.5 to 4.4.2
* Upgraded mongodb-driver-sync from 5.2.0 to 5.3.0
* Upgraded jobrunr from 7.3.1 to 7.3.2
* Upgraded project reactor from 3.6.11 to 3.7.2
* Upgraded kotlin from 2.0.21 to 2.1.0
* Upgraded jackson from 2.17.2 to 2.18.2
