Occurrent 0.5.0 is now available. It contains a new subscription api, a much improved in-memory event store (that now supports queries), 
as well as in-memory subscription component. Several components have been also moved and switched name (see below). 
Most noteworthy is that "Subscription" has been renamed to "SubscriptionModel". It was very confusing in the previous version since before you created a subscription (instance) from a subscription, but they both had the same name. 
Now you create a subscription (instance) from a _subscription model_ instead. For example:

```java
InMemorySubscriptionModel inMemorySubscriptionModel = new InMemorySubscriptionModel();
InMemoryEventStore inMemoryEventStore = new InMemoryEventStore(inMemorySubscriptionModel);

inMemorySubscriptionModel.subscribe("subscription1", System.out::println);
```

This version also introduces a new subscription dsl for Java and Kotlin (depend on `org.occurrent:subscription-dsl`). 
It allows you to configure subscriptions in a more concise way, for example you can do like this in Kotlin:

```kotlin
val subscriptionModel = SpringMongoSubscriptionModel(..)
val cloudEventConverter = GenericCloudEventConverter<DomainEvent>(..)

subscriptions(subscriptionModel, cloudEventConverter) {
    subscribe<GameStarted>("id1") { gameStarted ->
        log.info("Game was started $gameStarted")
    }
    subscribe<GameWon, GameLost>("id2") { domainEvent ->
        log.info("Game was either won or lost: $domainEvent")
    }
    subscribe("everything") { domainEvent ->
        log.info("I subscribe to every event: $domainEvent")
    }
} 
```

In Java, you can do like this:

```java
var subscriptions = new Subscriptions<DomainEvent>();
subscriptions.subscribe("id1", GameStarted.class, event -> System.out.println("Event was received: " + event.getClass().getSimpleName()));

```

Here are all changes:
* Renamed `org.occurrent.subscription.api.blocking.BlockingSubscription` to `org.occurrent.subscription.api.blocking.SubscriptionModel`. The reason for this is that it was previously
  very confusing to differentiate between a `org.occurrent.subscription.api.blocking.BlockingSubscription` (where you start/cancel subscriptions) and a `org.occurrent.subscription.api.blocking.Subscription` 
  (the actual subscription instance). The same thinking has been applied to the reactor counterparts as well (`org.occurrent.subscription.api.reactor.ReactorSubscription` has now been renamed to `org.occurrent.subscription.api.reactor.SubscriptionModel`).
* Derivatives of `org.occurrent.subscription.api.blocking.BlockingSubscription` such as `PositionAwareBlockingSubscription` has been renamed to `org.occurrent.subscription.api.blockking.PositionAwareSubscriptionModel`.
* Derivatives of the reactor counterpart, `org.occurrent.subscription.api.reactor.PositionAwareReactorSubscription` has been renamed `to`, such as has been renamed to `org.occurrent.subscription.api.reactor.PositionAwareSubscriptionModel`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.util.blocking.catchup.subscription.CatchupSubscriptionModelConfig` has been renamed to `org.occurrent.subscription.blocking.catchup.CatchupSubscriptionModelConfig`. 
* `org.occurrent.subscription.util.blocking.catchup.subscription.CatchupSubscriptionModel` has been renamed to `org.occurrent.subscription.blocking.catchup.CatchupSubscriptionModel`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.util.blocking.AutoPersistingSubscriptionModelConfig` has been renamed to `org.occurrent.subscription.blocking.durable.DurableSubscriptionModelConfig`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.util.blocking.BlockingSubscriptionWithAutomaticPositionPersistence` has been renamed to `org.occurrent.subscription.blocking.durable.DurableSubscriptionModel`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.nativedriver.blocking.BlockingSubscriptionForMongoDB` has been renamed to `NativeMongoSubscriptionModel`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.nativedriver.blocking.BlockingSubscriptionPositionStorageForMongoDB` has been renamed to `NativeMongoSubscriptionPositionStorage`.
* Removed `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.nativedriver.blocking.BlockingSubscriptionWithPositionPersistenceInMongoDB`. Use an `org.occurrent.subscription.blocking.DurableSubscriptionModel` from module `org.occurrent:durable-subscription` instead.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.spring.blocking.MongoDBSpringSubscription` has been renamed to `SpringMongoSubscription`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.spring.blocking.SpringBlockingSubscriptionForMongoDB` has been renamed to `SpringMongoSubscription`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.spring.blocking.SpringMongoDBSubscriptionPositionStorage` has been renamed to `SpringMongoSubscriptionPositionStorage`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.spring.reactor.SpringReactorSubscriptionForMongoDB` has been renamed to `ReactorMongoSubscription`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.spring.reactor.SpringReactorSubscriptionPositionStorageForMongoDB` has been renamed to `ReactorSubscriptionPositionStorage`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.util.reactor.ReactorSubscriptionWithAutomaticPositionPersistence` has been renamed to `org.occurrent.subscription.reactor.durable.ReactorDurableSubscriptionModel`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.util.reactor.ReactorSubscriptionWithAutomaticPositionPersistenceConfig` has been renamed to `org.occurrent.subscription.reactor.durable.ReactorDurableSubscriptionConfig`.
* `org.occurrent.eventstore.mongodb.spring.reactor.SpringReactorMongoEventStore` has been renamed to `ReactorMongoEventStore` since "Spring" is implicit.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.MongoDBFilterSpecification` has been renamed to `MongoFilterSpecification`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.MongoDBFilterSpecification.JsonMongoDBFilterSpecification` has been renamed to `MongoJsonFilterSpecification`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.MongoDBFilterSpecification.BsonMongoDBFilterSpecification` has been renamed to `MongoBsonFilterSpecification`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.internal.MongoDBCloudEventsToJsonDeserializer` has been renamed to `MongoCloudEventsToJsonDeserializer`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.internal.MongoDBCommons` has been renamed to `MongoCommons`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.MongoDBOperationTimeBasedSubscriptionPosition` has been renamed to `MongoOperationTimeSubscriptionPosition`.
* `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.MongoDBResumeTokenBasedSubscriptionPosition` has been renamed to `MongoResumeTokenSubscriptionPosition`.
* `org.occurrent.eventstore.mongodb.internal.OccurrentCloudEventMongoDBDocumentMapper` has been renamed to `OccurrentCloudEventMongoDocumentMapper`.
* `org.occurrent.eventstore.mongodb.spring.blocking.SpringBlockingMongoEventStore` has been renamed to `SpringMongoEventStore`.
* Renamed module `org.occurrent:subscription-util-blocking-catchup-subscription` to `org.occurrent:catchup-subscription`.
* Renamed module `org.occurrent:subscription-util-blocking-automatic-position-persistence` to `org.occurrent:durable-subscription`.
* Renamed module `org.occurrent:subscription-util-reactor-automatic-position-persistence` to `org.occurrent:reactor-durable-subscription`.
* Moved `org.occurrent.application.converter.implementation.GenericCloudEventConverter` to `org.occurrent.application.converter.generic.GenericCloudEventConverter`.
* Moved `org.occurrent.application.service.blocking.implementation.GenericApplicationService` to `org.occurrent.application.service.blocking.generic.GenericApplicationService`.
* Added a new "Subscription DSL" module that adds a domain event specific abstraction on-top of the existing subscription model api's. This DSL makes it easier to create subscriptions that are using
  domain events instead of cloud events. The module is called `org.occurrent:subscription-dsl`. For example:
  
  ```kotlin
  val subscriptionModel = SpringMongoSubscriptionModel(..)
  val cloudEventConverter = GenericCloudEventConverter<DomainEvent>(..)
  
  // Subscription DSL
  subscriptions(subscriptionModel, cloudEventConverter) {
    subscribe<GameStarted>("id1") { gameStarted ->
        log.info("Game was started $gameStarted")
    }
    subscribe<GameWon, GameLost>("id2") { domainEvent ->
        log.info("Game was either won or lost: $domainEvent")
    }
   subscribe("everything") { domainEvent ->
        log.info("I subscribe to every event: $domainEvent")
    }
  } 
  ```
* Implemented ability to delete cloud events by a filter in the in-memory event store.
* Added "listener" support to the in-memory event store. This means that you can supply a "listener" (a consumer) to the `InMemoryEventStore` constructor that
  will be invoked (synchronously) after new events have been written. This is mainly useful to allow in-memory subscription models.
* Added an in-memory subscription model that can be used to subscribe to events from the in-memory event store. Add module `org.occurrent:subscription-inmemory` and then instantiate it using:

  ```java
  InMemorySubscriptionModel inMemorySubscriptionModel = new InMemorySubscriptionModel();
  InMemoryEventStore inMemoryEventStore = new InMemoryEventStore(inMemorySubscriptionModel);
  
  inMemorySubscriptionModel.subscribe("subscription1", System.out::println);
  ```
* Renamed groupId `org.occurrent.inmemory` to `org.occurrent` for consistency. This means that you should depend on module `org.occurrent:eventstore-inmemory` instead of `org.occurrent.inmemory:eventstore-inmemory` when using the in-memory event store.
* Added support for querying the in-memory event store (all fields expect the "data" field works)
* Changed from `Executor` to `ExecutorService` in `NativeMongoSubscriptionModel` in the `org.occurrent:subscription-mongodb-native-blocking` module.
* Added a `@PreDestroy` annotation to the `shutdown` method in the `NativeMongoSubscriptionModel` implementation so that, if you're frameworks such as Spring Boot, you don't need to explicitly call the `shutdown` method when stopping.
* Added partial extension functions for `List<DomainEvent>`, import from the `partial` method from `org.occurrent.application.composition.command`.
