Occurrent 0.5.1 is now available. It's a small maintenance release and just contains two fixes that we forgot to include in version 0.5.0.

Changes are:

* Renamed `org.occurrent.subscription.redis.spring.blocking.SpringSubscriptionPositionStorageForRedis` to `SpringRedisSubscriptionPositionStorage`.
* Renamed `org.occurrent.subscription.mongodb.spring.reactor.ReactorMongoSubscription` to `ReactorMongoSubscriptionModel`.
                               

See news for [0.5.0](https://occurrent.org/news/2021/01/06/0_5_0.html) for more info.
