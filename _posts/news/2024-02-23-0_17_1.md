Occurrent 0.17.1 is released. Changes are: 

* Fixed issue in [Subscription DSL](https://occurrent.org/documentation#subscription-dsl) when using "subscribe" functions with a single event type different from the "base event type", i.e. this didn't work in previous version in Java:
  ```java                
  // GameEvent is the "base event type"
  Subscriptions<GameEvent> subscriptions = new Subscriptions<>(..);
  
  // GameStarted has GameEvent as parent, the following didn't compile in version 0.17.0 
  subscriptions.subscribe("mysubscription", GameStarted.class, gameStarted -> System.out.println("gameStarted: " + gameStarted));
  ```
* Using slf4j-api and not logback-classic in several modules that accidentally brought logback in as a compile time dependency.                                                                                 
* Upgraded slf4j-api from 2.0.5 to 2.0.12
* In the `spring-boot-starter-mongodb` module, it's now possible to enable/disable the event store or subscriptions from the `application.yaml` file. For example, you can disable the event store like this:

  ```yaml
  occurrent:
    event-store:
      enabled: false # Disable the creation of an event store Spring bean
  ```
  
  and the subscriptions like this:

  ```yaml
  occurrent:
    subscription:
      enabled: false # Disable the creation of beans related to subscriptions
  ```                                                                        
  
  This is useful if you have an application where you only need the event store or only need the subscriptions.
* Added `queryForList` Kotlin extension function to `EventStoreQueries` and `DomainEventQueries`. It works in a similar way as `queryForSequence`, but returns a `List` instead of a Kotlin `Sequence`.
* Fixed an issue with `CatchupSubscriptionModel` in which it threw an IllegalArgumentException when storing the position of stored events when using Atlas free tier.
