Occurrent 0.14.4 is now available. It's a small release that contains the following changes:

* Removed `PartialListCommandApplication`, `PartialStreamCommandApplication` and `PartialApplicationFunctions` in package 
  `org.occurrent.application.composition.command.partial` of module `command-composition`. They have all been replaced by
  `org.occurrent.application.composition.command.partial.PartialFunctionApplication` which is a generic form a partial function
  application that works on all kinds of functions, not only those taking `Stream` and/or `List`. A simple search and replace
  should be enough to migrate.
* Upgraded Jackson from 2.13.2 to 2.13.3
* Upgraded project reactor to 3.4.16 to 3.4.21
* Upgraded Spring Boot from 2.6.7 to 2.7.1
* Upgraded Java MongoDB driver from 4.5.1 to 4.6.1
* Upgraded Kotlin from 1.6.21 to 1.7.10
