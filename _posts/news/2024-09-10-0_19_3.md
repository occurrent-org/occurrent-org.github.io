Occurrent 0.19.3 is released with some smaller improvements:

* Added two kotlin extension functions to DomainEventQueries:
  1. `queryForList` that just takes a filter and a "SortBy"
  2. `queryForSequence` that just takes a filter and a "SortBy" 
  
The reason for this is to avoid ambiguity with other extension function when only specifying these values.
