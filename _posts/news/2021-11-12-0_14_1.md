Occurrent 0.14.1 is now available. It's a small release that contains the following changes:

* Using `insert` from `MongoTemplate` when writing events in the `SpringMongoEventStore`. Previously, the vanilla `mongoClient` was (accidentally) used for this operation.
* When using the spring boot starter project for MongoDB (`org.occurrent:spring-boot-starter-mongodb`), the transaction manager used by default is now configured to use "majority" read- and write concerns.
  To revert to the "default" settings used by Spring, or change it to your own needs, specify a `MongoTransactionManager` bean. For example:

  ```java                                                                       
  @Bean
  public MongoTransactionManager mongoTransactionManager(MongoDatabaseFactory dbFactory) {
    return new MongoTransactionManager(dbFactory, TransactionOptions.builder(). .. .build());
  }
  ```
* Separating read- and query options configuration so that you can e.g. configure queries made by `EventStoreQueries` and reads from the `EventStore.read(..)` separately.  
  This useful if you want to e.g. allow queries from `EventStoreQueries` to be made to secondary nodes but still force reads from `EventStore.read(..)` to be made from the primary.
  You can configure this by supplying a `readOption` (to configure the reads from the `EventStore`) and `queryOption` (for `EventStoreQueries`) in the `EventStoreConfig`. 
  This has been implemented for `SpringMongoEventStore` and `ReactorMongoEventStore`.
