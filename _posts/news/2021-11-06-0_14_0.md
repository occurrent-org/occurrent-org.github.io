Occurrent 0.14.0 is now available. It's features a new query DSL as well as a Spring Boot starter project to faster get started with Spring Boot. Changes are:

* Non-backward compatible change: CloudEventConverter's now has a third method that you must implement:

  ```java
  /**
   * Get the cloud event type from a Java class.
   *
   * @param type The java class that represents a specific domain event type
   * @return The cloud event type of the domain event (cannot be {@code null})
   */
  @NotNull String getCloudEventType(@NotNull Class<? extends T> type);
  ```
  
  The reason for this is that several components, such as the [subscription dsl](https://occurrent.org/documentation#subscription-dsl), needs to get the cloud event type from the domain event class. And since this is highly related to "cloud event conversion", 
  this method has been added there to avoid complicating the API. 
* Introduced the concept of CloudEventTypeMapper's. A cloud event type mapper is component whose purpose it is to get the [cloud event type](https://occurrent.org/documentation#cloudevents) from a domain event type and vice versa.
  Cloud Event Type mappers are used by certain `CloudEventConverter`'s to define how they should derive the cloud event type from the domain event as well as a way to reconstruct the domain event type from the cloud event type.
  and the new domain queries DSL. You should use the same type mapper instance for all these components. To write a custom type mapper, depend on the `org.occurent:cloudevent-type-mapper-api` module and implement the `org.occurrent.application.converter.typemapper.CloudEventTypeMapper`
  (functional) interface.
* Introduced a blocking Query DSL. It's a small wrapper around the [EventStoreQueries](https://occurrent.org/documentation#eventstore-queries) API that lets you work with domain events instead of CloudEvents. 
  Depend on the `org.occurrent:query-dsl-blocking` module and create an instance of `org.occurrent.dsl.query.blocking.DomainEventQueries`. For example:

  ```java                                                      
  EventStoreQueries eventStoreQueries = .. 
  CloudEventConverter<DomainEvent> cloudEventConverter = ..
  DomainEventQueries<DomainEvent> domainEventQueries = new DomainEventQueries<DomainEvent>(eventStoreQueries, cloudEventConverter);
   
  Stream<DomainEvent> events = domainQueries.query(Filter.subject("someSubject"));
  ```
  
  There's also support for skip, limits and sorting and convenience methods for querying for a single event:

  ```java                                                      
  Stream<DomainEvent> events = domainQueries.query(GameStarted.class, GameEnded.class); // Find only events of this type
  GameStarted event1 = domainQueries.queryOne(GameStarted.class); // Find the first event of this type
  GamePlayed event2 = domainQueries.queryOne(Filter.id("d7542cef-ac20-4e74-9128-fdec94540fda")); // Find event with this id
  ```
  
  There are also some Kotlin extensions that you can use to query for a `Sequence` of events instead of a `Stream`:

  ```kotlin
  val events : Sequence<DomainEvent> = domainQueries.queryForSequence(GamePlayed::class, GameWon::class, skip = 2) // Find only events of this type and skip the first two events
  val event1 = domainQueries.queryOne<GameStarted>() // Find the first event of this type
  val event2 = domainQueries.queryOne<GamePlayed>(Filter.id("d7542cef-ac20-4e74-9128-fdec94540fda")) // Find event with this id
  ```
* Introducing spring boot starter project to easily bootstrap Occurrent if using Spring. Depend on `org.occurrent:spring-boot-starter-mongodb` and create a Spring Boot application annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` as you would normally do.
  Occurrent will then configure the following components automatically:
    * Spring MongoDB Event Store instance (`EventStore`)
    * A Spring `SubscriptionPositionStorage` instance 
    * A durable Spring MongoDB competing consumer subscription model (`SubscriptionModel`)
    * A Jackson-based `CloudEventConverter`
    * A `GenericApplication` instance (`ApplicationService`)
    * A subscription dsl instance (`Subscriptions`)
    * A reflection based type mapper that uses the fully-qualified class name as cloud event type (you _should_ absolutely override this bean for production use cases) (`CloudEventTypeMapper`)
      For example, by doing:
      ```java
      @Bean
      public CloudEventTypeMapper<GameEvent> cloudEventTypeMapper() {
        return ReflectionCloudEventTypeMapper.simple(GameEvent.class);
      }
      ```
      This will use the "simple name" (via reflection) of a domain event as the cloud event type. But since the package name is now lost, the `ReflectionCloudEventTypeMapper` will append the package name of `GameEvent` when converting back into a domain event. 
      This _only_ works if all your domain events are located in the exact same package as `GameEvent`. If this is not the case you need to implement a more advanced `CloudEventTypeMapper` such as:

      ```kotlin
      class CustomTypeMapper : CloudEventTypeMapper<GameEvent> {
          override fun getCloudEventType(type: Class<out GameEvent>): String = type.simpleName
      
          override fun <E : GameEvent> getDomainEventType(cloudEventType: String): Class<E> = when (cloudEventType) {
              GameStarted::class.simpleName -> GameStarted::class
              GamePlayed::class.simpleName -> GamePlayed::class
              // Add all other events here!!
              ...
              else -> throw IllegalStateException("Event type $cloudEventType is unknown")
          }.java as Class<E>
      }
      ```
  See `org.occurrent.springboot.OccurrentMongoAutoConfiguration` if you want to know exactly what gets configured.
* Upgraded spring-boot from 2.5.4 to 2.5.6.
