Occurrent now require Java 17 instead of Java 8. This is major change to support the latest Spring client libraries for various databases such MongoDB and Redis. This was also done to better support Spring Boot 3 and jakartaee.
There are lots of changes under the hood, refactorings to make use of records, sealed classes and built-in functional constructs available in Java 17. For example:


* Refactored SubscriptionPositionStorageConfig to sealed interface
* Refactored CompetingConsumerSubscriptionModel
* Refactored StartAt to a sealed interface
* Refactored ClassName to a sealed interface
* Refactored RetryStrategy to a sealed interface
* Converted Deadline to a sealed interface
* Converted CompetingConsumer in CompetingConsumerSubscriptionModel to a record
* Converting Backoff to sealed interface
* Converting Condition and WriteCondition to sealed interfaces
* Converting SortBy to a sealed interface
* Refactor MaxAttempts to sealed interface and implementations to records
                                                                                                                                                                   

There has also been a lot of dependency upgrades.
