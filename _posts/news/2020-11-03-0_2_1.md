Occurrent 0.2.1 is now available, it's very small release that fixed some issues that were found in 0.2.0. It includes the following changes:

* Fixed typo in `CatchupSupportingBlockingSubscriptionConfig`, renamed method `dontSubscriptionPositionStorage` to `dontUseSubscriptionPositionStorage`.
* Added `getSubscriptionPosition()` to `PositionAwareCloudEvent` that returns `Optional<SubscriptionPosition>`.
* Removed duplicate `GenericCloudEventConverter` located in the `org.occurrent.application.service.blocking.implementation` package. Use `org.occurrent.application.converter.implementation.CloudEventConverter` instead.
* Handling if the domain model returns a null `Stream<DomainEvent>` in the `GenericApplicationService`. 

Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes.
