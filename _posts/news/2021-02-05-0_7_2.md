Occurrent 0.7.2 is now available. It's a very small release that really allows deploying Occurrent subscriptions to [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) free tier. 

Changelog:

* When running MongoDB subscriptions on services like Atlas, it's not possible to get the current time (global subscription position) when starting a new subscription since access is denied. 
  If this happens then the subscription will start at the "current time" instead (`StartAt.now()`). There's a catch however! If processing the very first event fails _and_ the application is restarted,
  then the event cannot be retried. If this is major concern, consider upgrading your MongoDB server to a non-shared environment.
