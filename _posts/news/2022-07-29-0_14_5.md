Occurrent 0.14.5 is now available. It's a small release that contains the following changes:

* Updated Kotlin extension functions for partial function application (`org.occurrent.application.composition.command.PartialExtensions`)
  to work on any type of function instead of just those that has `List` or `Sequence`.
* Fixed an issue in JacksonCloudEventConvert in which it didn't use the CloudEventTypeMapper correctly when calling `toCloudEvent` ([issue 119](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/issues/119)).
