Occurrent 0.14.6 is now available. It's a small release that contains the following changes:

* InMemoryEventStore now checks for duplicate events. You can no longer write two events with the same cloud event id and source to the same stream.
* Fixed an issue with command composition in Kotlin in which, in version 0.14.5, returned _all_ events in a stream and not only _new_ events.
