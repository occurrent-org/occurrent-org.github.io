Occurrent 0.14.2 is now available. It's a small release that contains the following changes:

* Improved `SpringMongoEventStore`, `MongoEventStore` and `ReactorMongoEventStore` so that they never do in-memory filtering of events that's of no interest.
* Added `oldStreamVersion` to `WriteResult` (that is returned when calling `write(..)` on an event store). The `getStreamVersion()` method has been deprecated in favor of `getNewStreamVersion()`.
* Upgraded to Kotlin 1.6.0
* Upgraded project reactor to 3.4.12
* Upgraded Java MongoDB driver to 4.4.0
* Upgraded Spring Data MongoDB to 3.3.0
* Upgraded Jackson to 2.13.0
* Upgraded amqp-client to 5.14.0
